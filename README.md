# Photo-Gallery App | MongoDB

The project consists of preparing a web application that uses advanced HTML documents, CSS style sheets, JavaScript scripts, jQuery library. The application should be responsive, interactive and semantically correct. The project consists of two stages: client side and server side.


The web application allows users to register and log in, as well as upload and display photos. The photos are stored in the MongoDB database, and the users in text files. The application uses the MVC architecture, which separates the business logic from the presentation layer. The application also supports pagination, which is the division of results into smaller parts.

The project required understanding the principles of operation of the apache server set up on a virtual machine and its configuration as an admin.
